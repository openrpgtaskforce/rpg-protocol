# RPG Protocol 

This is an attempt at creating a standard role play game network protocol. 

## Status

Things are very fluid at the moment as this project kicks off and we work out the basics like handshaking and authentication. You may find the current outlined proposal in [PLANNING](https://github.com/openrpgtaskforce/rpg-protocol/blob/master/PLANNING.md).
